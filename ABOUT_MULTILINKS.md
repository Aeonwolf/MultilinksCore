# Welcome to Multilinks

It is fair to say that most of us today are connected the cloud (what most people call the internet these days). We are connected 24/7, at home, at work and everywhere in between. However, most of the "things" in the real world in fact are not connected to the cloud and while these things are useful when we explicitly interact with them, they are not so useful when we don't.

But what if we do have the option of interacting with these "things" from anywhere and in real-time?

The goal of Multilinks is to be a community-driven, cloud-based platform aimed at making it easier for you (an application end-user/developer) and everyone to connect and communicate with other applications and Internet of things from anywhere and in real-time.
